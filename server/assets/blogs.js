        content: "Amazon is expanding its Samuel L. Jackson voice skill for its Alexa digital assistant to include tens of thousands more phrases, including much more of the actor’s iconic expletive-filled delivery. The company is also giving Jackson his own dedicated wake phrase: “Hey, Samuel.” The news follows Amazon’s announcement on Monday that it plans to add its next celebrity voice, Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, for the Indian market some time next year.\n\nThe Jackson partnership launched last December, allowing Alexa users to pay $0.99 to access the actor’s voice on Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices. Since then, Amazon says consumers complained that the integration was “overly burdensome,” because you effectively had to ask Alexa to ask for Jackson to reply to something.\n\nIn addition to that, the range of questions and exchanges you could have using the Jackson skill was limited, mostly because Amazon recorded only a small number of words using the actor’s real voice and relied on artificial intelligence to expand the library. When gathering feedback, Amazon says most owners of the skill — nearly 75 percent of which had expletives turned on — requested a more candid, off-the-cuff Jackson than was currently available via Alexa.\n\nNow, in today’s update, Jackson’s Alexa integration will feature around 30,000 more phrases, including five times the swear words, reports Variety. And you can activate the voice by just saying “Hey Samuel,” a feature that proved to be a “incredibly hard engineering challenge” Amazon says it needed to upgrade the on-device wake word detector to enable.\n\nSome examples include Jackson saying, “Look at that hot ball of gas and fire! No, don’t actually look,” when asking about the weather, and “Why do Jedis always burn their pancakes? They never turn to the dark side” if you ask for a joke.\n\nVariety also reports that Jackson now offers a touching response when asked what he’s up to, in which he’ll respond he’s thinking about the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. There are also other topical responses regarding Jackson’s future work, like one mentioning his upcoming Quibi animated show with Ryan Reynolds called Futha Mucka."

        content: "Astra, a California-based startup aimed at launching small satellites, successfully launched its rocket to space for the first time yesterday from Alaska, but the vehicle barely missed reaching the right speed to achieve orbit. Still, the company says the test flight was a major success and is preparing to fly its next rocket, this time with a payload on board.\n\n“This far exceeded our team’s expectations,” Chris Kemp, Astra’s CEO, said on a press call.\nAstra’s rocket, dubbed 3.2, took off from Alaska’s Pacific Spaceport Complex just before 4PM ET on Tuesday. The vehicle successfully climbed to space, performing all of its expected engine burns and separations. The rocket reached its target altitude of 390 kilometers, or about 242 miles, and a final speed of 7.2 kilometers per second, or more than 16,000 miles per hour. Unfortunately, that was just short of 7.68 kilometers per second, the speed the company needed to reach to make orbit.\n\n“We were just a few short seconds from putting the upper stage of the spacecraft in orbit,” Kemp says.\n\nThe company says it’s an easy fix for the next flight. Kemp blamed the problem on some residual liquid oxygen propellant leftover in the rocket’s tanks, which prevented the vehicle from getting where it needed to go. On the next flight, engineers simply need to adjust the ratio of the propellants in the tanks, Kemp said. “There are absolutely no design changes and no general hardware changes and no software changes,” Adam London, Astra’s co-founder, said during the call.\n\nKemp says that Astra has another rocket ready to go and a payload ready to fly on it. The company didn’t fly a payload on this flight, but the rocket did signal that it would have released a payload just fine if there had been one on the mission.\n\n“This outcome surprised us and is certainly a nice Christmas present for the whole team,” Kemp said.\n\nThis flight comes three months after Astra’s last launch attempt out of Alaska in September. During that flight, Astra’s Rocket 3.1, successfully took off, but the rocket started to drift and the vehicle’s engines shut down early. The rocket then fell back to Earth and exploded on impact.\n\nFormed in 2016, Astra is one of many startups dedicated to launching small satellites into space. So far, just one other launch company, Rocket Lab, has been successful in the arena and has been launching small payloads into orbit since 2018. Astra has claimed that just one launch on its rocket will cost $2.5 million."

        content: "Samsung is announcing the $199.99 Galaxy Buds Pro today, its most premium set of true wireless earbuds yet. They feature an in-ear design similar to the Galaxy Buds Plus but are aesthetically inspired by the Galaxy Buds Live. The Buds Pro aren’t bean-shaped, but they’ve got the same metallic-looking style and a similar charging case. The tweaked design “reduces the contact area between your ear and the bud, improving comfort and minimizing any clogged-up feeling,” according to Samsung.More important is that Samsung says they deliver the “best audio experience yet” of any of the company’s earbuds thanks to an 11mm woofer and 6.5mm tweeter. The active noise cancellation should also be much improved since these earbuds now create a full seal with your ear. Samsung has also refined its ambient sound mode, which now lets you amplify surrounding noise by up to 20 decibels. The Galaxy Buds Pro are able to detect when you’ve started speaking, and they can automatically switch into ambient sound mode and lower music volume when you do. We’ve seen this convenient trick on headphones like the Sony 1000XM4, but it’s still relatively rare in earbuds.Samsung says the Galaxy Buds Pro also offer the best microphone performance yet from the earbuds lineup; they’ve got three built-in microphones and a voice pickup unit to help you come through clearly on phone and video calls. “One of the outer microphones also has a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) rating, further eliminating background noises,” the company said in its press release. “In addition, Samsung has integrated its new Wind Shield technology into the Galaxy Buds Pro. While a less protrusive shape minimizes the wind contact area, specially designed chamber with mesh filters out wind interference.”\n\nBattery life is about on par with other premium ANC earbuds: Samsung says you can expect up to five hours of continuous playback with noise canceling enabled (eight if it’s off), and enough juice in the case for an additional 13 hours (20 hours with ANC off) of listening time. The Galaxy Buds Pro are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance, so they should be able to handle even your sweatiest workouts.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds Pro will come in black, silver, and purple colors to match the new Galaxy S21 lineup. You can preorder today, and they’ll be available from retailers as soon as tomorrow, January 15th. "

        content: "Apple is planning a major MacBook Pro redesign for the third quarter of 2021, according to a research note written by TF International Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo and reported on by MacRumors, 9to5Mac, and Apple Insider. Kuo calls it the first major redesign of the MacBook Pro since the introduction of the current generation in 2016. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has followed up with a report corroborating many of the same details.\n\nThe new MacBook Pro is said to have squared-off sides like the iPad Pro and the iPhone 12; the current laptop already has sharp edges, but it sounds like the top and bottom panels are going to be flatter than before as well. The new model will reportedly come in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes both featuring Apple-designed Arm processors, with no Intel options. Kuo says the laptops will use a similar heat pipe system to the current 16-inch MacBook Pro, giving more thermal headroom and enabling higher performance. Bloomberg reports that the new models will have “brighter, higher contrast” displays.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Kuo believes the new Pro laptops will backtrack on some of the controversial changes Apple made with the current generation. The OLED Touch Bar, for example, is said to have been replaced altogether by physical function keys. Kuo also says that there’ll be a wider range of ports reducing the need for dongles, though he doesn’t get specific. And a MagSafe magnetic charging connector is also set to return. According to Bloomberg, the connector will resemble the elongated pill-shape design of the discontinued MagSafe port.\n\nA new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s M1 processor was just released in November, but that model otherwise had near-identical hardware to the existing Intel version. If Kuo is to be believed — and his track record suggests that he is — the next models could be a huge improvement."

        content: "BMW is suspending its two-year-old car subscription service, The Verge has learned.\n\nAccess by BMW was launched in 2018 in Nashville as a pilot project to test out whether customers would want to have access to a fleet of fancy cars but not necessarily own one. But recent requests to sign up have been met with a disclaimer that the service is in the process of shutting down. A Nashville resident who was interested in applying for the subscription service was told that it was going to be defunct by the end of January.\n\n“Unfortunately the Access by BMW subscription program is ending on January 31st and we are no longer taking new members,” a sales representative said in an email.\n\nA BMW spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that BMW was winding down its pilot, though the company appears to be leaving the door open for future experiments. “The Access by BMW vehicle subscription program was launched in Nashville, TN in April of 2018 and was always intended to be a pilot program,” the spokesperson said. “As such, the pilot will conclude at the end of this month. We are in the process of developing the next iteration of Access by BMW and will share more information with you as it becomes available.”\n\nThe spokesperson declined to share sales numbers but acknowledged that “the program had reached its capacity limits.”\n\nDespite the imminent shutdown, the Access by BMW website is still up and running, with a link on the automaker’s North American site redirecting to it. “A new way of driving BMW is coming,” the homepage promises.\n\nAccess by BMW consisted of two tiers. For $2,000 a month, members could choose between models like the X5 SUV, 4 Series, and 5 Series sedans, including all plug-in hybrid versions. For the higher-tier $3,700-a-month fee, they could get M4, M5, or M6 convertibles as well as X5M and X6M SUVs. (BMW’s highest-end 7 Series was not available through the service). The fee included insurance, maintenance, and roadside assistance.\n\nIf that seems a bit pricey, you’re not wrong. The top-tier $3,700-a-month plan is almost three times the cost of leasing an M5 sedan in the Nashville area (though a lease requires a down payment of $5,724 and doesn’t include insurance and maintenance).\n\nSubscriptions have been a mixed bag for the auto industry. Ford walked away from its service last fall following low demand. Cadillac shut down its service Book in 2018, only to resurrect it several months later with fewer options. Last summer, Mercedes-Benz pulled the plug its Collection subscription service, citing mediocre sales.\n\nOther automakers have had some success. Porsche, Audi, Volvo, Nissan, and Jaguar are still offering some variation of a subscription service. Even the big car rental companies, Hertz and Enterprise, are getting in on the action. Most of these subscriptions are only available in specific cities and are still in the pilot phase."

        title: "Wonder Woman 1984 and Hamilton’s three biggest lessons for streaming",

        content: "Wonder Woman 1984 and Hamilton were two of 2020’s biggest films — at least where streaming was concerned. Recent third-party data suggests both releases drove crowds of subscribers to their streaming platforms (HBO Max and Disney Plus, respectively). More than any other movies that debuted online this year, Wonder Woman 1984 and Hamilton drove the most initial signups, according to new data from research firm Antenna. Data from research firm Screen Engine found similar results.\n\nBut digging into the data shows the successes of both releases are more complicated than they look. Unlike a conventional box office release, streaming success is measured not just in how many people saw the movie, but in how many people stuck around afterward. Measuring that success is much harder, but with this lesson, three new rules of the streaming game are already becoming clear.\n\nThis one is kind of obvious, but it’s nice to see it spelled out in the data. Wonder Woman 1984 led the pack for the most signups over a film’s opening weekend on streaming services, with Hamilton generating 71 percent as much and Soul 35 percent as much. Although, Wonder Woman 1984 was HBO Max’s first major release, while Soul premiered after The Mandalorian’s second season. (Its overall weekend signup numbers may be lower because people already had Disney Plus.)\n\nDetermining the value of “biggest” on streaming platforms is complicated. Neither WarnerMedia (HBO Max’s parent company) nor Disney shares data for their films’ performances. While those numbers would allow reporters and analysts to see total subscriber numbers and determine how much a single movie drives in subscription revenue, they’re not the most important figures. (It’s also difficult to translate streaming success into box office performance as there are too many variables, but Wonder Woman 1984’s domestic box office revenue in the film’s subsequent weeks following its initial release is far from phenomenal.)\nAlthough Hamilton drew in the most subscribers per single title on Disney Plus in 2020, the drop-off rate was higher than average Disney Plus subscribers who signed up for the service before the movie came out. Nearly a quarter of people who signed up for Disney Plus during Hamilton’s opening weekend canceled within 30 days, according to Antenna. After three months, less than 60 percent of that same subscriber group remained. Comparatively, about 70 percent of people who signed up for Disney Plus in June (about four weeks ahead of Hamilton’s premiere) remained subscribed three months later. This doesn’t imply that Disney Plus is in trouble — the platform had nearly 90 million subscribers in mid-December — but it speaks to the necessity of consistency.\n\nStreaming’s beauty is also a problem to solve: it’s extremely easy for people to sign up, and it’s even easier for people to cancel. While big titles bring in subscribers, it doesn’t necessarily mean people are going to stay subscribed. Take Hamilton: if people are signing up specifically for the filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway musical, they may not be as interested in staying for Star Wars or Marvel films and TV shows.\n\nThis group of subscribers is important for Disney, as they represent an audience Disney hasn’t already tapped into — but it’s a double-edged sword, as they’re more likely to cancel. People signing up ahead of Hamilton, however, may watch Hamilton when it lands on top of the other Disney properties they initially signed up to watch, but it’s not why they signed up. Figuring out how to keep both groups happy is essential."

        content: "Disney announced a virtual avalanche of updates and news for almost every one of its properties. But one of the company’s biggest franchises was strangely absent: in all the hullabaloo, where was Avatar?\n\nThere was no Avatar segment of the investor call, showing off preview images of the sequels and a logo or subtitle for Avatar 2. No news of any Avatar Disney Plus shows, or any animated spinoffs to help further expand the brand across the Disney empire. Amid more than 50 announcements covering Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar, the Na’vi were nowhere to be seen. Interconnected branding and stories has become Disney’s lifeblood, but Avatar isn’t taking part.\nThe first two sequels have been shooting concurrently for three years, and Avatar 2 — per Disney’s most recent theatrical release calendar — is still prominently on the schedule, for December 16th, 2022. And James Cameron’s sequels are set to alternate December slots each year with Disney’s other major sci-fi franchise, Star Wars. But while Disney was willing to announce a title card and details on its next Star Wars movie as far away as 2023 (the Patty Jenkins-helmed Rogue Squadron), the studio didn’t even mention the word “Avatar” during the four-hour-plus presentation.\n\nPart of the answer may lie in Avatar’s depreciation following its record-shattering debut. For a film as big as Avatar was in 2009, the movie itself has had a tiny impact on the overall cultural landscape disproportionate to its massive box office numbers. Other top films, like Titanic, Star Wars, and the Avengers movies, are part of the modern zeitgeist. Even the most out-of-touch person knows who Iron Man is, or has an opinion on whether Jack and Rose could have fit on that board. Avatar just doesn’t occupy the same place in people’s hearts, minds, or wallets anymore, outside of a far smaller subset of fans. It’s not clear it ever did.\n\nAvatar’s cultural prominence has faded over the years. Viral videos or posts trying to recall the details of the film have more prominence than the characters or worlds that the film so meticulously created. And Avatar’s paint-by-numbers story and focus on a white savior narrative have aged particularly poorly when viewed with fresh eyes that aren’t blinded by the fantastical computer-generated sights.\n\nIt’s an open question whether an Avatar sequel will be able to gross anything close to the original, which had the advantage of riding the dual waves of inflated 3D movie tickets and immersive CGI hype, neither of which are benefits a second movie, over a decade later, will have.\n\nAnd yet, Avatar didn’t gross $2.7 billion out of apathy toward the franchise. With Cameron’s reputation, it could be that he’ll manage to make lightning strike a third time, but with the huge price tags for the films, it’s a big gamble. (Disney itself hadn’t decided whether to greenlight Cameron’s fourth and fifth films when it first acquired the franchise.)\n\nDisney’s investor call announcements were a blueprint for the company’s future. That path is one built firmly on its strengths: popular brands like Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, expansions of modern animated classics like Moana and Toy Story, and shows that remake or further build out beloved properties like The Mighty Ducks or Percy Jackson and the Olympians.\n\nIn other words, Disney’s future is committed to franchises and brands that customers love. It’s a calculated, measured approach, the thing that separates it from the scattershot tactics of Netflix’s hundreds of original shows and movies that flare up into the spotlight for a few days or weeks and are then forgotten.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that Disney hasn’t thought about how to better integrate the Avatar franchise into its own stable of brands. But if Avatar isn’t in the spotlight as part of Disney’s future, it might be because the company has recognized that in 2020 (and beyond), the world of Pandora and the Na’vi just can’t measure up."

        content: "\nSpaceX launched a batch of 143 spacecraft to space from Florida on Sunday morning under the company’s new cost-cutting SmallSat Rideshare Program, breaking the record for the most satellites lofted into space on a single launch.\n\nThe Transporter-1 mission kicks off a potentially lucrative business line for SpaceX, which unveiled in 2019 its SmallSat Rideshare Program, essentially a carpool for dozens of satellites of different shapes and sizes. The program offers relatively cheap access to space for small satellite companies starting at $1 million for the first 485 pounds.\n\nMuch like a rideshare Uber, a company’s small satellite can hitch a ride to space with other spacecraft instead of buying an entire rocket at a much higher price.\n\nAfter scrubbing an initial launch attempt on Saturday due to bad weather, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off 24 hours later from its Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad at 10AM ET, sending a mix of shoebox-sized CubeSats and much heavier microsatellites to a 326-mile-high polar orbit — an unusual trajectory for a Florida launch site. SpaceX launched its first polar mission from Florida in August last year.\n\nThe launch, SpaceX’s third so far this year, marks the most satellites carried to space on a single rocket, a record previously held by an Indian satellite launch in 2017 carrying 104 satellites. The 143 spacecraft aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 include 48 Earth imaging satellites dubbed SuperDoves from Planet, 17 tiny communications satellites for Toronto-based Kepler, and 30 small satellites for the US and Europe packaged by Berlin, Germany-based Exolaunch.\n\nAlso aboard the flight are small capsules of human ashes arranged by Celestis, a spaceflight memorial company. Ten Starlink satellites are also hitching a ride, inching SpaceX toward the 1,000 mark for the number of active satellites in space supporting its broadband internet constellation.\n\nDARPA, the Pentagon’s R&D agency, pulled out from the rideshare mission earlier this month after its two 187-pound satellites were damaged during launch processing in Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe Transporter-1 mission, coming just four days after SpaceX launched 60 of its Starlink satellites to space, keeps pace with what’s set to be a remarkably eventful year in orbit as SpaceX, OneWeb and other companies race to build vast constellations of internet-beaming satellites. In the past 16 days, SpaceX has launched more satellites to space than what the entire world launched in any year before 2013, according to data compiled by Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer and expert satellite tracker.\n\nRideshare missions on larger rockets appeal to a growing demand for affordable launch services from small satellite companies, ramping up competition with companies like Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit with smaller rockets tailored for dedicated small satellite launches.\n"
